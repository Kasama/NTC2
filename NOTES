Thanks to Direwolf20 for giving me insight on how to improve the playing experience of NTC2!

Add quest info to clay quest, point to ex nihilo
Make it more clear that you get ice chunks from quest to get water
Make pollution chapter more clear, update it with new mechanics like what blocks it changes and stuff from the custom configs
Make it more clear that crucibles can use leaves to get water
Disable bronze sword from mek
Make a use for cinnabar
