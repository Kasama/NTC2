Thanks to Direwolf20 for giving me insight on how to improve the playing experience of NTC2!

Add quest info to clay quest, point to ex nihilo
Make it more clear that you get ice chunks from quest to get water
Make pollution chapter more clear, update it with new mechanics like what blocks it changes and stuff from the custom configs
Make it more clear that crucibles can use leaves to get water
Disable bronze sword from mek
Make a use for cinnabar
Make it really obvious that liquid experience and sulfur can make blaze powder
Add "Yeah no kiddin chief -Direwolf20" to thermal machine frame quest lol
Make it very clear you can get very easy EMC from mob caging vindicators for emeralds
fix creeper heads temperature
buff the amount of blocks the advanced filters eat, 16 is too small
Add rewards for thermal machines quests
make entangled a quest and explain its use

add tooltip to semi stable ingots lol (poor dire)
fix soul steel not converting blocks to ingots etc
disable RF tools ores in JEI
